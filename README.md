# stapleshighschoolscheduler
**Hi, I'm Owen Spangler, and this is my first Andriod app and first time coding in Java.** This app is designed to help students with their schedule at Staples High School. This app is still in early development, but as I teach myself over the summer and do some sick coding, the app should be mostly finalized by sometimes in 2018 or 2019. I dunno, I'll work on it whenever.

It is currently availible for download in the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=owenspangler.stapleshighschoolscheduler). The app is free, and never will have a cost to use.

The main code can be found at [this location](https://github.com/ospangler/stapleshighschoolscheduler/tree/master/app/src/main/java/owenspangler/stapleshighschoolscheduler)
