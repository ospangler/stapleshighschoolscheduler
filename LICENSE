DO ALMOST WHATEVER YOU WANT LICENCE

So, you want to use some of this code. I don't know why you would, but whatever.

Just credit me where possible, and keep attributions to others I've included in my code. Credit where credit is due. Don't try and pass this off as your own work.

Other than that, you can use the code as you wish, as long as you don't publish an app with a similar name to SHSS. There's better ones out there, you know.
